This document contains examples of marketing copy that can be used for landing pages, tweets, and ads. The copy is designed to highlight the "Aha! Moment" for each of the target personas.

## Persona 1: Alex, the Overwhelmed SRE

**"Aha! Moment":** Realizing they can enforce consistent policies across all services without changing application code.

### Landing Page Headline

**Stop chasing developers. Start enforcing resilience.**
Centrally manage timeouts, retries, and other policies across your entire polyglot architecture with IRL.

### Tweet

Tired of configuration drift taking down your microservices? 😠

With IRL, you can enforce consistent timeout and retry policies across Go, Python, Java, and more, all from a single `invariants.json` file.

No code changes required. #SRE #DevOps #Resilience

### Ad Copy (e.g., for a developer-focused newsletter)

**Subject: The 15-Minute Fix for Cascading Failures**

One misconfigured timeout is all it takes to bring down your entire system.

With IRL, you can enforce consistent timeout policies across your entire polyglot architecture in just 15 minutes. No more chasing developers, no more code changes.

Just centralized governance for a more resilient system.

## Persona 2: Maya, the AI Engineer

**"Aha! Moment":** Realizing they can offload all the defensive coding to a dedicated LLM Firewall.

### Landing Page Headline

**Ship your LLM app with confidence.**
IRL's "Sentinel" is an LLM Firewall that protects your application from prompt injection, hallucinations, and other common risks.

### Tweet

Worried about prompt injection? 😬

IRL's "Sentinel" acts as an LLM Firewall, allowing you to define semantic invariants to protect your app from malicious input and unexpected output.

Move fast, without breaking things. #AI #LLM #Security

### Ad Copy (e.g., for an AI-focused podcast)

**Subject: The Cure for Production Anxiety**

Putting your LLM into production shouldn't be a leap of faith.

IRL's "Sentinel" is an LLM Firewall that gives you the confidence to ship. Define your invariants, and let IRL handle the rest. No more writing boilerplate safety code, no more worrying about prompt injection.

Just a dedicated safety layer for your AI application.
