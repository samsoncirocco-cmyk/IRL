# Launch Plan: Driving Adoption of the Free Tier

This document outlines a plan for a launch campaign to drive adoption of IRL's "Seed/Hobbyist" free tier.

## 1. The "Getting Started" Guide

The first step is to create a comprehensive "Getting Started" guide that makes it as easy as possible for new users to get up and running with IRL. This guide should be prominently featured on the project's website and in all marketing materials.

**Content of the Guide:**

*   **Installation and Setup:** Clear, step-by-step instructions for installing and running the IRL sidecar.
*   **Your First Invariant:** A simple, "Hello World" style tutorial that shows users how to create their first invariant.
*   **Use Cases:** Links to the persona-driven blog posts and tutorials to showcase what's possible with IRL.
*   **Community:** A call to action to join the community Discord or Slack channel.

## 2. Promotion Plan

Once the "Getting Started" guide is in place, we will launch a promotional campaign to drive awareness and adoption of the free tier.

**Channels:**

*   **Social Media:**
    *   **Twitter:** A series of tweets highlighting the key features and benefits of IRL, with a focus on the "Aha! Moment" for each persona. Use the marketing copy examples as a starting point.
    *   **LinkedIn:** A more detailed post that explains the vision behind IRL and its potential to improve system resilience.
*   **Developer Forums:**
    *   **Reddit:** Post in relevant subreddits like `/r/sre`, `/r/devops`, and `/r/programming`. Be sure to engage with the community and answer questions.
    *   **Hacker News:** Submit a link to the "Getting Started" guide or one of the blog posts. The title should be compelling and highlight the problem that IRL solves.
*   **Content Marketing:**
    *   **Blog Posts:** The persona-driven blog posts will be the cornerstone of the content marketing efforts.
    *   **Guest Posts:** Reach out to popular developer blogs and offer to write a guest post about IRL.

## 3. Announcement Blog Post

We will publish a blog post on the project's website to officially announce the launch of the free tier.

**Draft of the Announcement Blog Post:**

**Title: Introducing IRL: The Free, Open Source Integration Resilience Layer**

Today, we're excited to announce the launch of the "Seed/Hobbyist" tier of IRL, a free, open source Integration Resilience Layer that helps you build more resilient systems.

At IRL, we believe that resilience shouldn't be a luxury. It should be a fundamental part of every system, regardless of its size or complexity. That's why we're making the core features of IRL available for free, forever.

**What is IRL?**

IRL is a language-agnostic sidecar proxy that sits between your services and their dependencies, acting as a centralized governance layer. With IRL, you can:

*   **Enforce consistent policies:** Define timeouts, retries, and other policies in a single `invariants.json` file.
*   **Prevent data corruption:** Use semantic invariants to protect your systems from "confidently wrong" AI data and API drift.
*   **Build an LLM Firewall:** Protect your AI applications from prompt injection, hallucinations, and other common risks.

**Get Started for Free**

The "Seed/Hobbyist" tier of IRL is free forever for 1 Sentinel. It's the perfect way to get started with IRL and experience the benefits of a dedicated resilience layer.
