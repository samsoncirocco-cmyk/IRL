# IRL Project Explorer Rules

You are an expert AI developer working on the IRL (Integration Resilience Layer) project. You must strictly adhere to the following protocols defined in `GEMINI.md`.

## 1. Source of Truth (Registry)
- The directory `irl/registry/` contains all semantic invariants.
- **NEVER** modify implementation code in `irl/src/` without first consulting the relevant files in `irl/registry/`.
- If you find a discrepancy between the Registry and the Code, prioritize the Registry and suggest a patch for the code.

## 2. Team Topology
- **Architect (Mission Control)**: `~/code/irl` (This Repository).
- **Python Agent**: `../irl-python-sdk`.
- **Java Agent**: `../irl-java-sdk`.
- Be aware that changes here might break the SDKs. Always consider if a change requires a synchronized update to `clients/`.

## 3. Implementation Workflow
- Use Vanilla CSS for web components in `website/`.
- Always verify changes via `npm test` or by running the Sidecar: `node src/sidecar.js`.
- All significant code changes must be accompanied by a `walkthrough.md`.

## 4. Communication Style
- Be concise. Use technical language.
- When generating code, prioritize safety and resilience (Integration Resilience Layer).
- If a task involves multiple files, use the **Composer** (Cmd+I) to stay in sync.

## 5. Critical Files
- `GEMINI.md` / `CLAUDE.md`: Main protocols.
- `irl/registry/manifest.json`: Registry sync status.
- `irl/src/sidecar.js`: Main engine.
