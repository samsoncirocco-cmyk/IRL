# IRL Next Steps & Recommendations

This document outlines the recommended next steps for the IRL project, based on a comprehensive review of the project's documentation and market research as of January 2026.

---

### **1. Product Development: Sharpen the "Unicorn Wedge"**

The research confirms that IRL's most immediate and compelling value proposition is as an **AI Output Firewall**. This directly addresses the acute pain points of the "AI Engineer" persona and aligns with the current market gap for "AI Integrity" solutions.

*   **Recommendation 1: Accelerate "Semantic Invariant Enforcement".** This is the current sprint goal and is the most critical feature for delivering on the "AI Output Firewall" promise. Prioritize the completion of `min`, `max`, and `regex` rule logic.
*   **Recommendation 2: Elevate the "Sentinel" Feature.** The "Sentinel" name is strong. Make it the cornerstone of your messaging to clearly communicate the AI firewall capabilities. All tutorials and examples should lead with this use case.
*   **Recommendation 3: Begin Scoping the "Impact Dashboard".** Immediately after the current sprint, the focus should shift to Step 9, the Impact Dashboard. This is crucial for demonstrating ROI to enterprise customers and VCs. The dashboard should visualize metrics like "Invariant Violations Blocked" and connect them to potential financial or operational risk avoided.

### **2. Marketing & Go-to-Market: From Personas to Pipeline**

The persona and pricing research provide a clear GTM strategy. The focus should now be on execution.

*   **Recommendation 1: Create Persona-Driven Content.** Develop a series of technical blog posts and tutorials explicitly targeting "Alex, the Overwhelmed SRE" and "Maya, the AI Engineer." Use their language and address their specific pain points.
    *   **For Alex:** A tutorial on "How to Enforce Consistent Timeouts Across a Polyglot Architecture in 15 Minutes."
    *   **For Maya:** A blog post on "Building an LLM Firewall: From Prompt Injection to Production Confidence."
*   **Recommendation 2: Weaponize the "Aha! Moment".** Use the "Aha! Moment" identified for each persona as the central theme in your marketing copy and product demos. Show, don't just tell, how IRL can save them 10+ hours a week.
*   **Recommendation 3: Drive Adoption with the Free Tier.** The "Seed/Hobbyist" tier is your most powerful marketing tool. Launch a campaign to get it into the hands of as many developers as possible. This will build a community, generate feedback, and create a funnel for the "Scale" tier.

### **3. Community & Ecosystem: Build a Defensible Moat**

Your open-source nature and free tier are significant competitive advantages. It's time to build a community around them.

*   **Recommendation 1: Launch a Community Hub.** Create a dedicated space (e.g., a Discord server or Slack channel) for users to ask questions, share what they're building, and interact with the core team. This will be invaluable for gathering feedback and identifying champions.
*   **Recommendation 2: Curate "Good First Issues".** To encourage contributions, create a backlog of well-defined, small tasks labeled as "good first issues." This lowers the barrier to entry for new contributors.
*   **Recommendation 3: Showcase Community Use Cases.** Actively look for and promote interesting projects built by the community. This provides social proof and inspires new users.
